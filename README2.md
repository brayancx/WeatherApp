#TECH USED
the technologies used to complete this project were the following. CSS,HTML,JAVE SCRIPT, AND REACT LIBRARY.

# The Approach
The approach for this project was to make a fully functioning weather app getting all its information from the provide API.
i was able to accomplish the goal by using my API key and displaying all of it's data. The second goal was to make the page look minimal and modern,
